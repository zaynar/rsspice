//! C
//! C        ekrecptr.inc Version 2  18-JUL-1995 (NJB)
//! C
//! C
//! C     This file declares parameters used in EK record pointers.
//! C     Each segment references data in a given record via two levels
//! C     of indirection:  a record number points to a record pointer,
//! C     which is a structured array of metadata and data pointers.
//! C
//! C     Record pointers always occupy contiguous ranges of integer
//! C     addresses.
//! C
//! C     The parameter declarations in this file depend on the assumption
//! C     that integer pages contain 256 DAS integer words and that the
//! C     maximum number of columns in a segment is 100.  Record pointers
//! C     are stored in integer data pages, so they must fit within the
//! C     usable data area afforded by these pages.  The size of the usable
//! C     data area is given by the parameter IPSIZE which is declared in
//! C     ekdatpag.inc.  The assumed value of IPSIZE is 254.
//! C
//! C
//! C     The first element of each record pointer is a status indicator.
//! C     The meanings of status indicators depend on whether the parent EK
//! C     is shadowed or not.  For shadowed EKs, allowed status values and
//! C     their meanings are:
//! C
//! C        OLD       The record has not been modified since
//! C                  the EK containing the record was opened.
//! C
//! C        UPDATE    The record is an update of a previously existing
//! C                  record.  The original record is now on the
//! C                  modified record list.
//! C
//! C        NEW       The record has been added since the EK containing the
//! C                  record was opened.  The record is not an update
//! C                  of a previously existing record.
//! C
//! C        DELOLD    This status applies only to a backup record.
//! C                  DELOLD status indicates that the record corresponds
//! C                  to a deleted OLD record in the source segment.
//! C
//! C        DELNEW    This status applies only to a backup record.
//! C                  DELNEW status indicates that the record corresponds
//! C                  to a deleted NEW record in the source segment.
//! C
//! C        DELUPD    This status applies only to a backup record.
//! C                  DELUPD status indicates that the record corresponds
//! C                  to a deleted UPDATEd record in the source segment.
//! C
//! C     In EKs that are not shadowed, all records have status OLD.
//! C
//! C
//!       INTEGER               OLD
//!       PARAMETER           ( OLD    =          1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               UPDATE
//!       PARAMETER           ( UPDATE = OLD    + 1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               NEW
//!       PARAMETER           ( NEW    = UPDATE + 1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               DELOLD
//!       PARAMETER           ( DELOLD = NEW    + 1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               DELNEW
//!       PARAMETER           ( DELNEW = DELOLD + 1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               DELUPD
//!       PARAMETER           ( DELUPD = DELNEW + 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     The following parameters refer to indices within the record
//! C     pointer structure:
//! C
//! C     Index of status indicator:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               STAIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( STAIDX = 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Each record pointer contains a pointer to its companion:  for a
//! C     record belonging to a shadowed EK, this is the backup counterpart,
//! C     or if the parent EK is itself a backup EK, a pointer to the
//! C     record's source record.  The pointer is UNINIT (see below) if the
//! C     record is unmodified.
//! C
//! C     Record companion pointers contain record numbers, not record
//! C     base addresses.
//! C
//! C     Index of record's companion pointer:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               RCPIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( RCPIDX = STAIDX + 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Each data item is referenced by an integer.  The meaning of
//! C     this integer depends on the representation of data in the
//! C     column to which the data item belongs.  Actual lookup of a
//! C     data item must be done by subroutines appropriate to the class of
//! C     the column to which the item belongs.  Note that data items don't
//! C     necessarily occupy contiguous ranges of DAS addresses.
//! C
//! C     Base address of data pointers:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               DPTBAS
//!       PARAMETER           ( DPTBAS = 2 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum record pointer size:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MXRPSZ
//!       PARAMETER           ( MXRPSZ = 254 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Data pointers are given the value UNINIT to start with; this
//! C     indicates that the data item is uninitialized.  UNINIT is
//! C     distinct from the value NULL.  NOBACK indicates an uninitialized
//! C     backup column entry.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               UNINIT
//!       PARAMETER           ( UNINIT = -1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               NULL
//!       PARAMETER           ( NULL   = UNINIT - 1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               NOBACK
//!       PARAMETER           ( NOBACK = NULL   - 1 )
//!
