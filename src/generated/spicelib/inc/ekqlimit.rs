//! C        ekqlimit.inc  Version 3    16-NOV-1995 (NJB)
//! C
//! C           Parameter MAXCON increased to 1000.
//! C
//! C        ekqlimit.inc  Version 2    01-AUG-1995 (NJB)
//! C
//! C           Updated to support SELECT clause.
//! C
//! C
//! C        ekqlimit.inc  Version 1    07-FEB-1995 (NJB)
//! C
//! C
//! C     These limits apply to character string queries input to the
//! C     EK scanner.  This limits are part of the EK system's user
//! C     interface:  the values should be advertised in the EK required
//! C     reading document.
//! C
//! C
//! C     Maximum length of an input query:  MAXQRY.  This value is
//! C     currently set to twenty-five 80-character lines.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXQRY
//!       PARAMETER           ( MAXQRY = 2000 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum number of columns that may be listed in the
//! C     `order-by clause' of a query:  MAXSEL.  MAXSEL = 50.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXSEL
//!       PARAMETER           ( MAXSEL = 50 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum number of tables that may be listed in the `FROM
//! C     clause' of a query: MAXTAB.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXTAB
//!       PARAMETER           ( MAXTAB = 10 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum number of relational expressions that may be listed
//! C     in the `constraint clause' of a query: MAXCON.
//! C
//! C     This limit applies to a query when it is represented in
//! C     `normalized form': that is, the constraints have been
//! C     expressed as a disjunction of conjunctions of relational
//! C     expressions. The number of relational expressions in a query
//! C     that has been expanded in this fashion may be greater than
//! C     the number of relations in the query as orginally written.
//! C     For example, the expression
//! C
//! C             ( ( A LT 1 ) OR ( B GT 2 ) )
//! C        AND
//! C             ( ( C NE 3 ) OR ( D EQ 4 ) )
//! C
//! C     which contains 4 relational expressions, expands to the
//! C     equivalent normalized constraint
//! C
//! C             (  ( A LT 1 ) AND ( C NE 3 )  )
//! C        OR
//! C             (  ( A LT 1 ) AND ( D EQ 4 )  )
//! C        OR
//! C             (  ( B GT 2 ) AND ( C NE 3 )  )
//! C        OR
//! C             (  ( B GT 2 ) AND ( D EQ 4 )  )
//! C
//! C     which contains eight relational expressions.
//! C
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXCON
//!       PARAMETER           ( MAXCON = 1000 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     MXJOIN is the maximum number of tables that can be joined.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MXJOIN
//!       PARAMETER           ( MXJOIN = 10 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     MXJCON is the maximum number of join constraints allowed.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MXJCON
//!       PARAMETER           ( MXJCON = 100 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum number of order-by columns that may be used in the
//! C     `order-by clause' of a query: MAXORD. MAXORD = 10.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXORD
//!       PARAMETER           ( MAXORD = 10 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum number of tokens in a query: 500. Tokens are reserved
//! C     words, column names, parentheses, and values. Literal strings
//! C     and time values count as single tokens.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXTOK
//!       PARAMETER           ( MAXTOK = 500 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum number of numeric tokens in a query:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXQNM
//!       PARAMETER           ( MAXQNM = 100 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum total length of character tokens in a query:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXCLN
//!       PARAMETER           ( MAXCLN = MAXQRY )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Maximum length of literal string values allowed in queries:
//! C     MAXSTR.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               MAXSTR
