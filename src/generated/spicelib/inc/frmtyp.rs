//! C$ Parameters
//! C
//! C     INERTL      an inertial frame that is listed in the routine
//! C                 CHGIRF and that requires no external file to
//! C                 compute the transformation from or to any other
//! C                 inertial frame.
//! C
//! C     PCK         is a frame that is specified relative to some
//! C                 INERTL frame and that has an IAU model that
//! C                 may be retrieved from the PCK system via a call
//! C                 to the routine TISBOD.
//! C
//! C     CK          is a frame defined by a C-kernel.
//! C
//! C     TK          is a "text kernel" frame.  These frames are offset
//! C                 from their associated "relative" frames by a
//! C                 constant rotation.
//! C
//! C     DYN         is a "dynamic" frame.  These currently are
//! C                 parameterized, built-in frames where the full frame
//! C                 definition depends on parameters supplied via a
//! C                 frame kernel.
//! C
//! C     SWTCH       is a "switch" frame. These frames have orientation
//! C                 defined by their alignment with base frames selected
//! C                 from a prioritized list. The base frames optionally
//! C                 have associated time intervals of applicability.
//! C
//! C     ALL         indicates any of the above classes. This parameter
//! C                 is used in APIs that fetch information about frames
//! C                 of a specified class.
