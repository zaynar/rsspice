//! C
//! C     DSK type 2 plate expansion factor
//! C     ---------------------------------
//! C
//! C     The factor XFRACT is used to slightly expand plates read from DSK
//! C     type 2 segments in order to perform ray-plate intercept
//! C     computations.
//! C
//! C     This expansion is performed to prevent rays from passing through
//! C     a target object without any intersection being detected. Such
//! C     "false miss" conditions can occur due to round-off errors.
//! C
//! C     Plate expansion is done by computing the difference vectors
//! C     between a plate's vertices and the plate's centroid, scaling
//! C     those differences by (1 + XFRACT), then producing new vertices by
//! C     adding the scaled differences to the centroid. This process
//! C     doesn't affect the stored DSK data.
//! C
//! C     Plate expansion is also performed when surface points are mapped
//! C     to plates on which they lie, as is done for illumination angle
//! C     computations.
//! C
//! C     This parameter is user-adjustable.
//! C
//!       DOUBLE PRECISION      XFRACT
//!       PARAMETER           ( XFRACT = 1.D-10 )
//!
//! C
//! C     The keyword for setting or retrieving this factor is
//! C
//!       INTEGER               KEYXFR
//!       PARAMETER           ( KEYXFR = 1 )
//!
//! C
//! C     Greedy segment selection factor
//! C     -------------------------------
//! C
//! C     The factor SGREED is used to slightly expand DSK segment
//! C     boundaries in order to select segments to consider for
//! C     ray-surface intercept computations. The effect of this factor is
//! C     to make the multi-segment intercept algorithm consider all
//! C     segments that are sufficiently close to the ray of interest, even
//! C     if the ray misses those segments.
//! C
//! C     This expansion is performed to prevent rays from passing through
//! C     a target object without any intersection being detected. Such
//! C     "false miss" conditions can occur due to round-off errors.
//! C
//! C     The exact way this parameter is used is dependent on the
//! C     coordinate system of the segment to which it applies, and the DSK
//! C     software implementation. This parameter may be changed in a
//! C     future version of SPICE.
//! C     
//!       DOUBLE PRECISION      SGREED
//!       PARAMETER           ( SGREED = 1.D-8 )
//!
//! C
//! C     The keyword for setting or retrieving this factor is
//! C
//!       INTEGER               KEYSGR
//!       PARAMETER           ( KEYSGR = KEYXFR + 1 )
//!
//! C
//! C     Segment pad margin
//! C     ------------------
//! C
//! C     The segment pad margin is a scale factor used to determine when a
//! C     point resulting from a ray-surface intercept computation, if
//! C     outside the segment's boundaries, is close enough to the segment
//! C     to be considered a valid result.
//! C
//! C     This margin is required in order to make DSK segment padding
//! C     (surface data extending slightly beyond the segment's coordinate
//! C     boundaries) usable: if a ray intersects the pad surface outside
//! C     the segment boundaries, the pad is useless if the intercept is
//! C     automatically rejected.
//! C
//! C     However, an excessively large value for this parameter is
//! C     detrimental, since a ray-surface intercept solution found "in" a
//! C     segment can supersede solutions in segments farther from the
//! C     ray's vertex. Solutions found outside of a segment thus can mask
//! C     solutions that are closer to the ray's vertex by as much as the
//! C     value of this margin, when applied to a segment's boundary
//! C     dimensions.
//!
//!       DOUBLE PRECISION      SGPADM
//!       PARAMETER           ( SGPADM = 1.D-10 )
//!
//! C
//! C     The keyword for setting or retrieving this factor is
//! C
//!       INTEGER               KEYSPM
//!       PARAMETER           ( KEYSPM = KEYSGR + 1 )
//!       
//! C
//! C     Surface-point membership margin
//! C     -------------------------------
//! C
//! C     The surface-point membership margin limits the distance
//! C     between a point and a surface to which the point is
//! C     considered to belong. The margin is a scale factor applied
//! C     to the size of the segment containing the surface.
//! C
//! C     This margin is used to map surface points to outward
//! C     normal vectors at those points.
//! C
//! C     If this margin is set to an excessively small value,
//! C     routines that make use of the surface-point mapping won't
//! C     work properly.
//! C
//!       DOUBLE PRECISION      PTMEMM
//!       PARAMETER           ( PTMEMM = 1.D-7 )
//!
//! C
//! C     The keyword for setting or retrieving this factor is
//! C
//!       INTEGER               KEYPTM
//!       PARAMETER           ( KEYPTM = KEYSPM + 1 )
//!
//! C
//! C     Angular rounding margin
//! C     -----------------------
//! C
//! C     This margin specifies an amount by which angular values
//! C     may deviate from their proper ranges without a SPICE error
//! C     condition being signaled.
//! C
//! C     For example, if an input latitude exceeds pi/2 radians by a
//! C     positive amount less than this margin, the value is treated as
//! C     though it were pi/2 radians.
//! C
//! C     Units are radians.
//! C     
//!       DOUBLE PRECISION      ANGMRG
//!       PARAMETER           ( ANGMRG = 1.D-12 )
//!
//! C
//! C     This parameter is not user-adjustable.
//! C
//! C     The keyword for retrieving this parameter is
//! C
//!       INTEGER               KEYAMG
//!       PARAMETER           ( KEYAMG = KEYPTM + 1 )
//!
//!
//! C
//! C     Longitude alias margin
//! C     ----------------------
//! C
//! C     This margin specifies an amount by which a longitude
//! C     value can be outside a given longitude range without
//! C     being considered eligible for transformation by
//! C     addition or subtraction of 2*pi radians.
//! C
//! C     A longitude value, when compared to the endpoints of
//! C     a longitude interval, will be considered to be equal
//! C     to an endpoint if the value is outside the interval
//! C     differs from that endpoint by a magnitude less than
//! C     the alias margin.
//! C
//! C
//! C     Units are radians.
//! C     
//!       DOUBLE PRECISION      LONALI
//!       PARAMETER           ( LONALI = 1.D-12 )
//!
//! C
//! C     This parameter is not user-adjustable.
//! C
//! C     The keyword for retrieving this parameter is
//! C
//!       INTEGER               KEYLAL
//!       PARAMETER           ( KEYLAL = KEYAMG + 1 )
//!
