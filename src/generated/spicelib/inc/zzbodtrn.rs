//! C$ Parameters
//! C
//! C     MAXL        is the maximum length of a body name.
//! C
//! C     MAXP        is the maximum number of additional names that may
//! C                 be added via the ZZBODDEF interface.
//! C
//! C     NPERM       is the count of the mapping assignments built into
//! C                 SPICE.
//! C
//! C     MAXE        is the size of the lists and hashes storing combined
//! C                 built-in and ZZBODDEF-defined name/ID mappings. To
//! C                 ensure efficient hashing this size is the set to the
//! C                 first prime number greater than ( MAXP + NPERM ).
//! C
//! C     NROOM       is the size of the lists and hashes storing the
//! C                 POOL-defined name/ID mappings. To ensure efficient
//! C                 hashing and to provide the ability to store nearly as
//! C                 many names as can fit in the POOL, this size is
//! C                 set to the first prime number less than MAXLIN
//! C                 defined in the POOL umbrella routine.
