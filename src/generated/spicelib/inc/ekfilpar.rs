//! C        ekfilpar.inc  Version 1  28-MAR-1995 (NJB)
//! C
//! C     These parameters apply to EK files using architecture 4.
//! C     These files use a paged DAS file as their underlying file
//! C     structure.
//! C
//! C     The metadata for an architecture 4 EK file is very simple:  it
//! C     consists of a single integer, which is a pointer to a tree
//! C     that in turn points to the segments in the EK.  However, in the
//! C     interest of upward compatibility, one integer page is reserved
//! C     for the file's metadata.
//! C
//! C
//! C     Size of file parameter block:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               FPARSZ
//!       PARAMETER           ( FPARSZ = 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     All offsets shown below are relative to the beginning of the
//! C     first integer page in the EK.
//! C
//! C
//! C     Index of the segment pointer tree---this location contains the
//! C     root page number of the tree:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               SGTIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( SGTIDX  =  1 )
//!
