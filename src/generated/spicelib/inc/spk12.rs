//! C
//! C     MAXDEG         is the maximum allowed degree of type 12
//! C                    interpolating polynomials. If the value of MAXDEG
//! C                    is increased, the SPICELIB routine SPKPVN must be
//! C                    changed accordingly. In particular, the size of
//! C                    the record passed to SPKRnn and SPKEnn must be
//! C                    increased, and comments describing the record size
//! C                    must be changed.
//! C
//! C                    The record size requirement is
//! C
//! C                       MAXREC = ( 3 * ( MAXDEG + 1 ) )  +  3

//! C
//! C     TOLSCL         is a tolerance scale factor (also called a
//! C                    "relative tolerance") used for time coverage
//! C                    bound checking. TOLSCL is unitless. TOLSCL
//! C                    produces a tolerance value via the formula
//! C
//! C                       TOL = TOLSCL * MAX( ABS(FIRST), ABS(LAST) )
//! C
//! C                    where FIRST and LAST are the coverage time bounds
//! C                    of a type 2 segment, expressed as seconds past
//! C                    J2000 TDB.
//! C
//! C                    The resulting parameter TOL is used as a tolerance
//! C                    for comparing the input segment descriptor time
//! C                    bounds to the first and last epoch covered by the
//! C                    sequence of time intervals defined by the inputs
//! C                    to SPKW12:
//! C
//! C                       EPOCH1
//! C                       STEP
//! C                       N
//!
//! C
//! C     Tolerance scale for coverage gap at the endpoints
//! C     of the segment coverage interval:

//!       DOUBLE PRECISION      TOLSCL
//!       PARAMETER           ( TOLSCL = 1.D-13 )
