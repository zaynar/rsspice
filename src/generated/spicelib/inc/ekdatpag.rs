//! C     Include Section:  EK Data Page Parameters
//! C
//! C        ekfilpar.inc  Version 1  03-APR-1995 (NJB)
//! C
//! C     These parameters apply to EK files using architecture 4.
//! C     These files use a paged DAS file as their underlying file
//! C     structure.
//! C
//! C     In paged DAS EK files, data pages are structured:  they contain
//! C     metadata as well as data.  The metadata is located in the last
//! C     few addresses of each page, so as to interfere as little as
//! C     possible with calculation of data addresses.
//! C
//! C     Each data page belongs to exactly one segment.  Some bookkeeping
//! C     information, such as record pointers, is also stored in data
//! C     pages.
//! C
//! C     Each page contains a forward pointer that allows rapid lookup
//! C     of data items that span multiple pages.  Each page also keeps
//! C     track of the current number of links from its parent segment
//! C     to the page.  Link counts enable pages to `know' when they
//! C     are no longer in use by a segment; unused pages are deallocated
//! C     and returned to the free list.
//! C
//! C     The parameters in this include file depend on the parameters
//! C     declared in the include file ekpage.inc.  If those parameters
//! C     change, this file must be updated.  The specified parameter
//! C     declarations we need from that file are:
//! C
//! C        INTEGER               PGSIZC
//! C        PARAMETER           ( PGSIZC = 1024 )
//! C
//! C        INTEGER               PGSIZD
//! C        PARAMETER           ( PGSIZD = 128 )
//! C
//! C        INTEGER               PGSIZI
//! C        PARAMETER           ( PGSIZI = 256 )
//! C
//! C
//! C
//! C     Character pages use an encoding mechanism to represent integer
//! C     metadata.  Each integer is encoded in five consecutive
//! C     characters.
//! C
//! C
//! C     Character data page parameters:
//! C
//! C
//! C     Size of encoded integer:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               ENCSIZ
//!       PARAMETER           ( ENCSIZ = 5 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Usable page size:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               CPSIZE
//!       PARAMETER           ( CPSIZE = 1014 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Location of character forward pointer:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               CFPIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( CFPIDX = CPSIZE + 1)
//!  
//!  
//! C
//! C     Location of character link count:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               CLCIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( CLCIDX = CFPIDX + ENCSIZ )
//!  
//!  
//! C
//! C     Double precision data page parameters:
//! C
//! C     Usable page size:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               DPSIZE
//!       PARAMETER           ( DPSIZE = 126 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Location of d.p. forward pointer:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               DFPIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( DFPIDX = DPSIZE + 1)
//!  
//!  
//! C
//! C     Location of d.p. link count:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               DLCIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( DLCIDX = DFPIDX + 1 )
//!  
//!  
//! C
//! C     Integer data page parameters:
//! C
//! C     Usable page size:

//!       PARAMETER           ( IPSIZE = 254 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     Location of integer forward pointer:
//! C
//!       INTEGER               IFPIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( IFPIDX = IPSIZE + 1)
