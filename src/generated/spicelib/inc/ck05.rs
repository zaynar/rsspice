//! C     CK type 5 subtype codes:
//! C
//! C
//! C     Subtype 0:  Hermite interpolation, 8-element packets. Quaternion
//! C                 and quaternion derivatives only, no angular velocity
//! C                 vector provided. Quaternion elements are listed
//! C                 first, followed by derivatives. Angular velocity is
//! C                 derived from the quaternions and quaternion
//! C                 derivatives.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               C05TP0
//!       PARAMETER           ( C05TP0 = 0 )
//!
//!
//! C
//! C     Subtype 1:  Lagrange interpolation, 4-element packets. Quaternion
//! C                 only. Angular velocity is derived by differentiating
//! C                 the interpolating polynomials.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               C05TP1
//!       PARAMETER           ( C05TP1 = C05TP0 + 1 )
//!
//!
//! C
//! C     Subtype 2:  Hermite interpolation, 14-element packets.
//! C                 Quaternion and angular angular velocity vector, as
//! C                 well as derivatives of each, are provided. The
//! C                 quaternion comes first, then quaternion derivatives,
//! C                 then angular velocity and its derivatives.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               C05TP2
//!       PARAMETER           ( C05TP2 = C05TP1 + 1 )
//!
//! C
//! C     Subtype 3:  Lagrange interpolation, 7-element packets. Quaternion
//! C                 and angular velocity vector provided.  The quaternion
//! C                 comes first.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               C05TP3
//!       PARAMETER           ( C05TP3 = C05TP2 + 1 )

//!
//!       INTEGER               C05PS1
//!       PARAMETER           ( C05PS1 = 4 )
//!
//!       INTEGER               C05PS2
//!       PARAMETER           ( C05PS2 = 14 )
//!
//!       INTEGER               C05PS3
//!       PARAMETER           ( C05PS3 = 7 )
