//! C                 component of the difference table contained in a type
//! C                 21 SPK difference line. MAXTRM replaces the fixed
//! C                 table parameter value of 15 used in SPK type 1
//! C                 segments.
//! C
//! C                 Type 21 segments have variable size. Let MAXDIM be
//! C                 the dimension of each component of the difference
//! C                 table within each difference line. Then the size
//! C                 DLSIZE of the difference line is
//! C
//! C                    ( 4 * MAXDIM ) + 11

//! C                 MAXTRM is the largest allowed value of MAXDIM.
