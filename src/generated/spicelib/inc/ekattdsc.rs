//! C     This include file declares parameters used in EK column
//! C     attribute descriptors.  Column attribute descriptors are
//! C     a simplified version of column descriptors:  attribute
//! C     descriptors describe attributes of a column but do not contain
//! C     addresses or pointers.

//! C
//! C     Size of column attribute descriptor
//! C
//!       INTEGER               ADSCSZ
//!       PARAMETER           ( ADSCSZ = 6 )
//!  
//!  
//! C
//! C     Indices of various pieces of attribute descriptors:
//! C
//! C
//! C     ATTSIZ is the index of the column's class code.  (We use the
//! C     word `class' to distinguish this item from the column's data
//! C     type.)
//! C
//!       INTEGER               ATTCLS
//!       PARAMETER           ( ATTCLS = 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     ATTTYP is the index of the column's data type code (CHR, INT, DP,
//! C     or TIME).  The type is actually implied by the class, but it
//! C     will frequently be convenient to look up the type directly.
//! C
//! C
//!       INTEGER               ATTTYP
//!       PARAMETER           ( ATTTYP = ATTCLS + 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     ATTLEN is the index of the column's string length value, if the
//! C     column has character type.  A value of IFALSE in this element of
//! C     the descriptor indicates that the strings have variable length.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               ATTLEN
//!       PARAMETER           ( ATTLEN = ATTTYP + 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     ATTSIZ is the index of the column's element size value.  This
//! C     descriptor element is meaningful for columns with fixed-size
//! C     entries.  For variable-sized columns, this value is IFALSE.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               ATTSIZ
//!       PARAMETER           ( ATTSIZ = ATTLEN + 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     ATTIDX is the location of a flag that indicates whether the column
//! C     is indexed.  The flag takes the value ITRUE if the column is
//! C     indexed and otherwise takes the value IFALSE.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               ATTIDX
//!       PARAMETER           ( ATTIDX = ATTSIZ + 1 )
//!  
//! C
//! C     ATTNFL is the index of a flag indicating whether nulls are
//! C     permitted in the column.  The value at location NFLIDX is
//! C     ITRUE if nulls are permitted and IFALSE otherwise.
//! C
//!       INTEGER               ATTNFL
//!       PARAMETER           ( ATTNFL = ATTIDX + 1 )
