//! C     Within the EK system, operators used in EK queries are
//! C     represented by integer codes.  The codes and their meanings are
//! C     listed below.
//! C
//! C     Relational expressions in EK queries have the form
//! C
//! C        <column name> <operator> <value>
//! C
//! C     For columns containing numeric values, the operators
//! C
//! C        EQ,  GE,  GT,  LE,  LT,  NE
//! C
//! C     may be used; these operators have the same meanings as their
//! C     Fortran counterparts.  For columns containing character values,
//! C     the list of allowed operators includes those in the above list,
//! C     and in addition includes the operators
//! C
//! C        LIKE,  UNLIKE
//! C
//! C     which are used to compare strings to a template.  In the character
//! C     case, the meanings of the parameters
//! C
//! C        GE,  GT,  LE,  LT
//! C
//! C     match those of the Fortran lexical functions
//! C
//! C        LGE, LGT, LLE, LLT
//! C
//! C
//! C     The additional unary operators
//! C
//! C        ISNULL, NOTNUL
//! C
//! C     are used to test whether a value of any type is null.

//!       PARAMETER           ( GE     =  EQ  +  1 )

//!       INTEGER               GT
//!       PARAMETER           ( GT     =  GE  +  1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               LE
//!       PARAMETER           ( LE     =  GT  +  1 )

//!       PARAMETER           ( NE     =  LT  +  1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               LIKE
//!       PARAMETER           ( LIKE   =  NE     +  1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               UNLIKE
//!       PARAMETER           ( UNLIKE =  LIKE   +  1 )
//!  
//!       INTEGER               ISNULL
//!       PARAMETER           ( ISNULL =  UNLIKE +  1 )
//!
